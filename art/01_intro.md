    Case Study:
      art contest

!SLIDE

[ hold apparel art contests ]

!SLIDE larger

[ run daily, weekly, monthly sales ]

!SLIDE larger

[ looking to move forward with a backlog of features ]

!SLIDE larger

[ did an intensive on-site visit ]

!SLIDE larger

[ began working on lighter feature fixes ]

!SLIDE larger

[ automating manual processes ]

!SLIDE larger

[ tweaking small domain problems ]

!SLIDE larger

[ getting swamped daily with slow response times ]

!SLIDE larger

[ used newrelic to track HOT SPOTS in production ]

!SLIDE larger

[ focused code audit on the pages in question ]

!SLIDE larger

[ began characterization testing ]

!SLIDE 

    The problem:

      models are too tangled,
      with lots of raw SQL, so 
      characterizing requires 
      lots of state

!SLIDE 

      this is one of the situations 
      where it becomes clear that
      characterization testing is 
      a VERY different craft than
      green-field TDD development.

!SLIDE larger

[ can't do mocking and stubbing ]

!SLIDE larger

[ are forced to set up application state ]

!SLIDE larger

[ ensure that database pulls are consistent ]

!SLIDE larger

[ then we can refactor ]
