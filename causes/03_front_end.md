    Front-end is King

       The interaction exposed on the front-end
       *IS* the "domain model".

!SLIDE

[ focus on JS magic, AJAX interactions ]

!SLIDE

[ occasional UI revamps, "new look" ]

!SLIDE

[ the story backlog is primarily filled with trivial 
  but time-consuming bugs in the UI ]

!SLIDE

[ domain modelling is an afterthought, implementation is
  crammed in to fit behind whatever convoluted workflow 
  the UI suggests ]

!SLIDE

[ no use of presenters or true MVC abstractions to buffer
  the domain model from the front-end ]
