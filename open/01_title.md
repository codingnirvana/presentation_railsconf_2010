    The rules of the talk:

        I will be going *FAST*
        but you might be able to follow on 
        your laptop via the online presentation.
        
        I know it's difficult to read code on slides,
        but code is key here, so I'm going to
        try this and I will go FAST to maximize 
        the amount of ground we cover.
