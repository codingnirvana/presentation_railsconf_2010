This is a  [showoff](http://github.com/schacon/showoff) presentation.

    sudo gem install showoff
    git clone git://github.com/rick/presentation_railsconf_2010.git
    cd presentation_railsconf_2010
    showoff serve

Or, you can run it via rack (e.g., using Passenger) by just installing the showoff gem
and pointing to the rackup file (config.ru).

I may have a copy live and running here:
